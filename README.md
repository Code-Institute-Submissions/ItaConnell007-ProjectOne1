### A website built for a fictional beauty salon.

I wanted to make a static and responsive website with a gradient colour overlay and banner image.
On the landing page I wanted hover button effects for the "Find Out" and "Read More" buttons.
For the navigation I wanted a hamburger menu with a verticle side menu.
Going down the page, I wanted a features section, description of services, testiminoials, and a contact us section.
On the features page, like the rest of this website I designed this with CSS & Flexbox.
I wanted to showcase four services provided by the salon, where a gradient colour will come over the image with a description of services provided. 
I want to include a testimonial section with twitter icon, with some pictures of the customers to add a personal element.
Then finally the contact section at the bottom, with the opening hours, the links to social media and how to get in touch.

As I continued on the design process I added a banner image for behind the text, and applied a blue gradient overlay.

For the hamburger navigation menu, I wanted to inculde each section of the webpage.

For the services offered page, I included four key service, with a linear gradient overlay to see the description on each picture.
