# ProjectOne

I wanted to make a static and responsive website 
with a gradient colour overlay and banner image
Hover button effects 
Hamburger menu  
Verticle side menu
Features page
Designed with CSS, Flexbox 
There is a feature title, small description with icon on the left and on the right side an image
A section with services images
Gradient colour will come over the image with a description of services provided 
I want to include a testimonial section with twitter icon
Then finally the contact section at the bottom

I would love to tweek this website more, but I unfortunately have run out of time for this project.

After the submission, I will include wireframes, my though processess behind each section, I want to work on the reesponsivity of this website as with mobile it needs a little more fine tuning. Additionally I could add more pages.
I would possibly include an i-frame from maps.ie to locate the buisness.
Additionally I would pass this website through more testing through google lighthouse, https://ui.dev/amiresponsive, peers etc.

Technology I Used:

CSS / Flexbox

Font Awesome
Used for all the icons in this project

GoogleFonts
Used for all the fonts used in this project and to compare potential fonts.
